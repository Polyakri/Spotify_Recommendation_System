# Spotify_Recommendation_System with Clustering

This repository contains code for a Spotify recommendation system using clustering, specifically the K-Means algorithm. The goal is to group similar songs together and provide personalized recommendations based on user preferences. In this example, we will use the popular song "Pepas" by Farruko as a reference.

The dataset is downloaded from the Kaggle, and is uploaded here for easy access.

The steps for this recommendation system are.

1. Load and prepare the data
2. Plot the SSE for different cluster numbers and find the elbow point
3. For the number of clusters of the elbow point, train the model and get the labels/clusters
4. Find for the same cluster the 11 closest songs
5. For each cluster pick a random song and find the 3 nearest in the cluster.
